# Kalinga Baby

Kalinga Baby is an all-in-one parenting app designed to support parents through pregnancy, baby care, milestones, and more.

The name **“Kalinga”** means **“care”** or **“nurture”**, reflecting the app’s mission to lovingly support parents and babies every step of the way.

Starting with a feature to track and summarize a baby’s daily food intake, the app will expand to include developmental milestones, health logs, and other helpful parenting tools.
