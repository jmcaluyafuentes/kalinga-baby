# Kalinga Baby

**Kalinga Baby** is an all-in-one parenting app designed to support parents through pregnancy, baby care, milestones, and more.

The name **“Kalinga”** means **“care”** or **“nurture”**, reflecting the app’s mission to lovingly support parents and babies every step of the way.

The app currently focuses on features like food intake tracking and user authentication, with many exciting expansions planned in future versions.

## Why I Built Kalinga Baby

As a new parent, I wanted a simple and reliable way to track our baby’s daily routines and important moments. **Kalinga Baby** started as a personal project to solve this problem, while also helping me grow my skills as a developer. It has become a practical tool for our family.

This app keeps important baby information organised and accessible anywhere, anytime, something my wife and I have found very helpful in our parenting journey.

I’ve also seen how valuable this app can be to others. Friends who are expecting or have just welcomed a baby often ask us about our experiences — and now, they can refer to this app for helpful insights and practical guidance.

In addition, **Kalinga Baby aims to help other new parents**, especially through the upcoming **Parenting Tips and Helpful Resources** section, where they can **learn from other parents' experiences**. This is more than just an app, it’s a **community**.
