# Kalinga Baby

Kalinga Baby is an all-in-one parenting app designed to support parents through pregnancy, baby care, milestones, and more.

The name **“Kalinga”** means **“care”** or **“nurture”**, reflecting the app’s mission to lovingly support parents and babies every step of the way.

Starting with a feature to log and summarize a baby’s daily food intake, the app is growing to include sleep tracking, milestone logging, health and vaccination records, and helpful parenting resources.

## Why I Built Kalinga Baby

As a new parent, I wanted a simple and reliable way to track my baby’s daily routines and important moments. At the same time, I saw this as a meaningful project where I could apply and grow my skills in full-stack web development.

**Kalinga Baby** is the result of that vision — a personal tool turned portfolio piece, built with React, TypeScript, Material UI, Node.js, and MongoDB.

It’s incredibly convenient to have all our baby’s important information in one place that is accessible whenever and wherever we are. My wife agrees this app has been a great help in our parenting journey.

I’ve also seen how valuable this app can be to others. Friends who are expecting or have just welcomed a baby often ask us about our experiences — and now, they can refer to this app for helpful insights and practical guidance.
