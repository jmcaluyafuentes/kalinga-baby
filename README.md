## Why I Built Kalinga Baby

As a new parent, I wanted a simple and reliable way to track our baby‚Äôs daily routines and important moments. **Kalinga Baby** started as a personal project to solve this problem, while also helping me grow my skills as a developer. It has become a practical tool for our family.

This app keeps important baby information organised and accessible anywhere, anytime, something my wife and I have found very helpful in our parenting journey.

I‚Äôve also seen how valuable this app can be to others. Friends who are expecting or have just welcomed a baby often ask us about our experiences ‚Äî and now, they can refer to this app for helpful insights and practical guidance.

In addition, **Kalinga Baby aims to help other new parents**, especially through the upcoming **Parenting Tips and Helpful Resources** section, where they can **learn from other parents' experiences**. This is more than just an app, it‚Äôs a **community**.

## üìù Lessons Learned

### Avoid Bulk Imports from `@mui/icons-material`

When using MUI icons, **do not import multiple icons in a single line** like this:

```typescript
// ‚ùå This causes high file reads and build failures on Windows:
import { Visibility, VisibilityOff } from "@mui/icons-material";
Instead, use individual imports for better tree-shaking and performance:
```
Instead, use individual imports:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Recommended: tree-shaking friendly imports
import Visibility from "@mui/icons-material/Visibility";
import VisibilityOff from "@mui/icons-material/VisibilityOff";
```

This prevents ‚ÄúEMFILE: too many open files‚Äù errors during vite build, especially on Windows machines with lower file descriptor limits. It also reduces build times and bundle size.
